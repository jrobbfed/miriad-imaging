# miriad-imaging
nroParams_jrf.csh contains info about the NRO images that is used in the other scripts.

### Flux ratio between NRO and CARMA
------------
fluxscale_jrf.csh deconvolves the NRO map and models the NRO visibilities with a subset of CARMA pointings. Its result is NRO visibilities and dirty map as imaged by the CARMA 6m6m baselines, and the CARMA dirty map with the same baselines.

ratio_jrf.csh takes the CARMA and NRO dirty maps from fluxscale_jrf.csh and generates ratio maps, with an optional flux limit mask applied.

ratio.py makes some plots of the flux ratio.

### Make NRO visibilities
------------------
makeUVcombined_jrf.csh takes the NRO map and CARMA visibilities and makes the NRO visibilites by deconvolving and simulating observations with all CARMA baselines. The script also applies a flux scale factor found above, when input into a parameter file.

### Invert, Clean, and Restore
----------------------
images_line_isella.csh takes the CARMA and NRO visibilities (generated by makeUVcombined_jrf.csh) and makes the combined images, cleans, and restores the clean maps.

### Scripts to run other scripts
-------------------------
make_ratio.csh is a script to run ratio_jrf.csh several times with different cutoffs and on different channels.

do_makeUVcombined.csh runs makeUVcombined_jrf.csh with user-specified options.

time_clean.csh sets the options for images_line_isella.csh and times the execution.
